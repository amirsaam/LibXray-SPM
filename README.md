# LibXray-SPM

libXray as a Swift Package: `Package.swift` points directly at the
`libxray-apple-cgo.zip` asset of every [XTLS/libXray release](https://github.com/XTLS/libXray/releases),
and the raw C bridge hiding in its `LibXray.xcframework` is covered by a small
typed Swift API.

libXray is a wrapper XTLS builds for embedding Xray-core into iOS, macOS, and
tvOS clients. That is exactly what this package gives you, in two layers:

- A binary target whose URL and SHA-256 checksum name one XTLS release,
  updated by a nightly job. SwiftPM downloads the zip per version, verifies
  the hash, unpacks `LibXray.xcframework`, and caches it, so this repository
  itself stores no binaries.
- `XrayKit`, a Swift module over the engine's single JSON entry point.
  `Xray.Assembly` turns intent into a launchable document, `Xray.Session`
  owns launch lifecycles, `Xray.Config` is the configuration value, and
  `Xray` answers one-shot questions.

## Requirements

macOS 13+, iOS 15+, tvOS 17+, Swift 5.9 / Xcode 15+. The framework carries no
watchOS or visionOS slices because XTLS does not build those, so the package
declares no support for them either. Since the framework is static, linking
needs `Security.framework` and `libresolv`; the package wires both through its
own target settings, so nothing is required of your app target. On the first
resolve of a version SwiftPM fetches the ~100 MB zip from XTLS, checks the
checksum, and unpacks it; later builds on the same machine reuse the cached
framework without another download.

## Installation

Xcode: File > Add Package Dependencies, and enter

```
https://github.com/amirsaam/LibXray-SPM.git
```

In `Package.swift`:

```swift
.package(
    url: "https://github.com/amirsaam/LibXray-SPM.git",
    .exact("26.10.29")
)
```

Pick Exact Version in Xcode's requirement dropdown (or write `.exact`
yourself as above). Exact is the recommended setup for this package.

Versions here mirror the XTLS/libXray release the framework came from, with
same names upstream uses minus the "libXray" part: upstream "libXray v26.10.29"
is release/tag `v26.10.29` here.

Why exact rather than `upToNextMajor` or `upToNextMinor`: XTLS/libXray
publishes daily calver releases, so an open-ended requirement turns everyone
who resolves your project onto that day's rebuild, on whatever cadence Xcode
happens to resolve, without a decision on your side. Each version is one
~100 MB download on first use, and an engine update rewrites how your
connections behave, for better or worse. With `.exact`, an engine change only
happens in a commit you write and can review, and CI builds stay
reproducible across machines and months. Moving is deliberate: change the
string to the tag you want (check the Releases page here or upstream's), and
the next resolve pulls that engine and nothing else.

`Update To Latest Package Versions` in Xcode does not override an exact pin;
it only picks versions the requirement allows, so your chosen version is safe
from stray bumps. If you do want the newest engine as it lands rather than
reviewing each one, `.upToNextMinor` is the loose alternative, chosen
deliberately and with the download cost in mind.

## Importing

```swift
import XrayKit
```

The import exposes everything: the `Xray` namespace, `Xray.Session`,
`Xray.Config`, the support types, and the underlying C functions `CGoInvoke` /
`CGoFree` for when a change has not reached this wrapper yet.

## The engine in ninety seconds

Xray-core runs in-process. You give it a complete JSON configuration, it
launches listeners and outbounds inside your app, and it keeps running until
you stop it or replace it. Everything else is helper work on top: turning
subscription texts or share links into that JSON, validating configs, probing
servers, and picking free ports. The engine keeps no session history you can
read back; your app owns the lifecycle.

```swift
import XrayKit

// 1. Hold a session for as long as its engine should live
let session = Xray.shared.newSession(logger: { print("[xray]", $0) })

// 2. Describe what you want; get a working document back
let config = try Xray.shared.proxyConfiguration(
    .shareLinks(pastedText),
    routing: Xray.shared.routing(
        rules: [Xray.shared.routingRule(domains: ["malware.example.com"],
                                        destination: .block)],
        final: .proxy
    ),
    log: Xray.shared.log(level: .warning)
)

// 3. Launch it, and stop it later
try session.start(config)
try session.stop()
```

## API reference

Everything below is reachable after `import XrayKit`. Values are built through
factories on `Xray.shared` — value inits are internal, so user code passes
values to functions and never spells a type name to construct one. Blocking
calls expect a
background task from UI code (or use the async variants). Failures surface as
`Xray.Error` with four cases (`.engineFailed`, `.bridgeFailed`,
`.invalidInput`, `.geoAssets`), catchable like any Swift error.

### `Xray.Assembly`: one value in, one document out

`Xray.Assembly` is the easy path and the one most apps should use. You
describe intent — where the proxy comes from, which entries to open, where
traffic goes — and `assemble()` returns a launchable `Xray.Config`. No tag
bookkeeping, no merge closures. Every field is optional except `source`:

```swift
// One call, no structs: conversion plus entries and sections.
try Xray.shared.proxyConfiguration(
    .shareLinks(text),   // required: .shareLinks or .json
    remarks: "main",     // label stored in the document; nil omits it
    socksPort: 10808,    // socks entry on 127.0.0.1; nil drops it
    httpPort: nil,       // set to add an HTTP entry on 127.0.0.1
    routing: nil,        // the routing section; nil leaves conversion output alone
    dns: nil,            // verbatim dns section; nil leaves it out
    log: nil             // verbatim log section; nil leaves it out
)

// Full control: tune the assembly, then assemble it.
var assembly = Xray.shared.assembler(.shareLinks(text))
assembly.socks = try Xray.shared.socksEntry(port: 10880)
assembly.routing = Xray.shared.routing(rules: [...])
assembly.metricsPort = 24242          // adds Metrics listener + stats + policy
assembly.observatory = Xray.shared.observatory(subjectSelector: ["proxy"])
assembly.tun = try Xray.shared.tun(name: "utun7", fileDescriptor: fd)
assembly.patch = { $0["log"] = ["loglevel": "warning"] }  // runs last
let config = try assembly.assemble()
```

How it works, in order: `source` converts (share links become outbounds; the
first converted outbound is the `.proxy` destination everywhere else), verbatim
sections (`dns`, `fakeDNS`, `log`, `routing`, `observatory` when set, metrics
when `metricsPort` is set) are written, the
tun inbound is appended when `tun` is set (with `xray.tun.fd` merged into
`env` when it carries a descriptor), entries are appended, standards
(`.direct` / `.block` /
`.dns`) are appended when routing references them but the document lacks them,
and `patch` runs last. Then the geo asset check runs (see
[Geo databases](#geo-databases)): routing or dns references like
`geosite:category-ads` fail assembly with `.geoAssets` when the database is
missing or unreadable.

Three promises hold for every assembly:

- `.json` accepts a full document or just the `outbounds` — a partial
  document is completed, never replaced. `{"outbounds":[{...}]}` is enough
  input when you already own the server JSON.
- The assembled document keeps the converted proxy tag (typically the link's
  `#fragment`), appends anything it derived, and never deletes what
  conversion produced — a whole `outbounds` key in `patch` would be the one
  way to lose the real server, so don't put one there.
- Destinations are logical, not tags: `.proxy` resolves to the converted
  outbound's real tag (assigned `"proxy"` if it had none), `.direct` /
  `.block` / `.dns` resolve to standard outbounds added automatically when
  referenced but missing, and `.custom("tag")` passes a tag through verbatim
  for outbounds you provide yourself. Sending traffic to `.proxy` when the
  document has no outbounds is an `.invalidInput` error.

Entries are the mode. `socks` (default `127.0.0.1:10808`, tagged `socks-in`),
`http` (default nil: `127.0.0.1:10809`, tagged `http-in`), and `dnsRelay`
(default: a `dokodemo-door` on `127.0.0.1:10810` relaying to `1.1.1.1:53`
over UDP, feeding the `dns-out` outbound) open the local entry points; set
any to nil to drop it. Proxy mode is entries on the loopback interface; TUN
mode is setting `tun` to an `Xray.TunEntry`, which appends a real `tun`
inbound (tagged `"tunIn"` by default) that captures device-wide — both can
coexist. Each entry carries its own `auth` (`Xray.Credentials`, nil means
open); the low-level `Options.credentials` still exists for hand-built
sessions, guarding every SOCKS inbound at once and leaving the tun inbound
alone (tun takes no auth: packets, not connections).

Entry details:

- `socksEntry(tag:listen:port:udp:auth:sniffing)` — defaults
  `"socks-in"`, `"127.0.0.1"`, `10808`, `true`, nil, and default
  sniffing. Open entries write `auth: "noauth"`; guarded ones write
  `auth: "password"` with the pair in `users`.
- `httpEntry(tag:listen:port:auth:sniffing)` — defaults `"http-in"`,
  `"127.0.0.1"`, `10809`, nil, and default sniffing. Open entries carry
  no `settings` key at all; guarded ones write the pair in `accounts` (the
  HTTP inbound has no `auth` field in the engine schema).
- `dnsRelay(tag:listen:port:address:remotePort:network:)` — defaults
  `"dns-in"`, `"127.0.0.1"`, `10810`, `"1.1.1.1"`, `53`, `"udp"`. It has no
  sniffing of its own; the assembly's `sniffing` covers it like any inbound
  without settings.

### `Xray.Config`: the document as a value

```swift
public struct Config {   // inits are internal; build one via Xray.shared.configuration
    public var json: String
    public func shareLinks() throws -> String
    public func validate() throws
    public enum Source { case json(String); case shareLinks(String) }
}
```

(All nested under `Xray`: `Xray.Config`, `Xray.Config.Source`. `decodeSubscription`
and `generateAgeKeyPair` live on the shared instance: `Xray.shared`.)

- `configuration(.json(_))` stores text untouched. No validation happens here; that is
  `validate()`'s job.
- `configuration(.shareLinks(_):ageSecret:)` accepts vless, vmess, trojan, ss, socks, and
  hysteria2 share links, newline-separated mixed feeds, legacy vmess QR
  texts, and `{"outbounds":[...]}` JSON as input. Entries the engine cannot
  build are dropped instead of failing the call; if nothing survives, it
  throws `Xray.Error` ("no valid outbound found"). Throwing on half-specified
  links — e.g. vless URIs without any security settings — is normal. When
  the feed exports Age-encrypted content, pass the `AGE-SECRET-KEY-...`
  string as `ageSecret`.
- `shareLinks()` goes back: one routable outbound, one share link,
  newline-separated. A document with no routable outbounds yields an empty
  string rather than an error.
- `validate()` checks a configuration without starting anything; the thrown
  error carries the engine's parser complaint, which is the cheapest way to
  reject bad user input.
- `decodeSubscription` (on `Xray.shared`) unwraps a provider's Age-encrypted
  subscription export: text starting with the Age armor header is decrypted
  with `ageSecret` (the same secret handling
  `configuration(.shareLinks:ageSecret:)` accepts), and *any other text comes back
  unchanged*. It does not parse links and does not base64-decode — a link
  list, a base64 blob, or a JSON blob goes to
  `configuration(.shareLinks:ageSecret:)`, which does all three.

`json` is plain text you can persist, log, or edit between calls. Note the
engine's answer for share-link input keeps only projected, buildable
outbounds, so what you get back is already pruned to what this build can run.

### `Xray.Session`: build, tweak, then launch

`Xray.Session` is the layer a VPN app holds onto. It owns the launch
lifecycle with an optional log sink, and its `build` is the low-level path
underneath assemblies: same pipeline, knob by knob, with `transform` running
last for full control. Reach for it when an assembly hides something you need
to do by hand. One session per engine — starting again replaces the running
instance.

Concurrency: `Session` is `@unchecked Sendable` — safe to hold across `Task`
boundaries, with internal state behind a lock and bridge calls serialized on
the transport lane. Keep each session on one serial context anyway:
`logger` runs on the caller's thread, and interleaving two sessions'
start/stop sequences is a logic race no lock referees. `Assembly` is
deliberately not `Sendable`: its `patch` closure runs exactly once on the
assembling thread, so conforming would only force `@Sendable` on user code
for zero gain.

Values are built the same way, through factories on the shared instance:

```swift
let session = Xray.shared.newSession(logger: { print("[xray]", $0) })
let config = try Xray.shared.configuration(.shareLinks(pastedText))
try Xray.shared.validate(.shareLinks(pastedText))
let assembly = Xray.shared.assembler(.shareLinks(pastedText))

// One call, no structs: converted document with a socks inbound on 10808.
let proxy = try Xray.shared.proxyConfiguration(
    .shareLinks(pastedText),
    socksPort: 10880,
    routing: Xray.shared.routing(rules: [Xray.shared.routingRule(domains: ["geosite:category-ads-all"], destination: .block)])
)
try session.start(proxy)
```

```swift
let session = Xray.shared.newSession(logger: { print("[xray]", $0) })

// Inspect before committing: builds JSON, applies the pipeline, starts nothing.
let config = try session.build(
    .shareLinks(pastedText),
    options: Xray.shared.options(
        sniffing: Xray.shared.sniffing(),
        transform: { $0["log"] = ["loglevel": "warning"] }
    )
)

// Launch from a source, an assembled config, raw JSON you control end to
// end, or a config file on disk.
try session.start(.json(savedJSON))
try session.start(config)
try session.start(rawJSON: savedJSON)
try session.start(contentsOf: configFileURL)

// Async variants free the caller while the engine blocks.
try await session.start(.shareLinks(pastedText))
try await session.validate(.json(savedJSON))

// Deadline variant for providers: the system kills a start that overstays
// its time budget, so give up first — the half-started instance is stopped
// before the throw, which the provider can catch and retry. Providers must
// use this (or the plain async variant): the sync starts cannot be bounded.
try await session.start(.shareLinks(pastedText), deadline: .seconds(20))

// One call for the whole provider start: fetch, unwrap, top up geo assets,
// launch under a deadline. The feed is fetched fresh every call — nothing
// cached, nothing auto-refreshed. Feeds are capped at the engine's own
// 16 MiB request limit (`timeoutSeconds`, 30 by default, bounds the wait);
// anything past the cap throws before decoding. assetDirectory becomes
// xray.location.asset unless the options already set it.
try await session.start(
    remoteSubscription: feedURL,
    assetDirectory: dataDir,
    options: Xray.shared.options(tun: tun, metricsPort: verifiedPort)
)

// Provider sanity before launch: loopback-only inbounds plus a tun inbound.
try session.preflightForProvider(.shareLinks(pastedText), options: opts)

// Same check as values, for UI: [] means provider-ready, anything else
// renders next to its fix instead of parsing an error string.
let issues = try session.preflightIssues(.shareLinks(pastedText), options: opts)

try session.stop()
try session.isRunning() -> Bool
```

`Xray.Config.Source` is `.json(String)` or `.shareLinks(String)`; share links
are converted through the engine first, then everything flows through the
same pipeline: environment, tun, observatory, sniffing, dns, fakedns, log,
routing, credentials, then `transform` last, then the geo asset check.

`Options` fields and defaults: `sniffing` (nil), `transform` (nil),
`routing` (nil — replaces any routing section already in the document),
`credentials` (nil — when set, guards every SOCKS inbound and rejects a
document with none as misconfiguration; the tun inbound is untouched),
`tun` (nil — set to an `Xray.TunEntry` for device-wide capture),
`environment` (nil — entries merged into the document's `env`, the section
the engine turns into its own process environment at launch: use it for
`xray.location.asset` and friends; keys already in the document win),
`observatory` (nil — see `Xray.Observatory` under traffic; setting it
without `metricsPort` throws `.invalidInput` at build, because the probe
answers are published on the metrics endpoint and would otherwise read
empty forever),
`geoCheck` (true — refuse to assemble a document whose routing or dns
references `geosite:` / `geoip:` categories the engine has no readable
database for), `dns` (nil — replaces any dns section), `fakeDNS` (nil —
replaces any fakedns section), `log` (nil — replaces any log section).

Notes on the pieces:

- `Xray.Sniffing` merges a `sniffing` object into every inbound that does not
  already define one. Fields: `destOverride` (default
  `["http", "tls", "quic", "fakedns"]`), `enabled` (default true),
  `routeOnly` (default false), `domainsExcluded` (default empty),
  `metadataOnly` (default false). Inbounds with their own settings keep them.
- `transform` mutates the parsed configuration in place and runs last, so it
  overrules everything, including sniffing and routing. It works on a typed
  tree (`Xray.JSONObject`, values are `Xray.JSONValue`), so there is nothing
  to cast: literals build documents, subscripts and dynamic members read them.
  ```swift
  var doc: Xray.JSONValue = ["log": ["loglevel": "warning"]]
  doc["log"]?["loglevel"] = "error"
  doc.log?.loglevel?.stringValue // "error"
  ```
- `logger` gets lifecycle notes (what is launching, byte counts of the final
  JSON). Set it at init or any time after. Every note also lands in the
  `recentLogs()` ring buffer (last 200, oldest first) — the flight recorder
  for the package side.
- `connectedSince` stamps when the running instance came up (nil before the
  first start, nil after every stop). Pair it with traffic totals, which
  reset on every launch, for uptime math.
- `recentEngineLogs(_ kind: EngineLogKind, lines:)` tails the engine's own
  log file (`.access` / `.error`) named by the last assembled document's log
  section. The bridge exposes no log stream,
  so the engine must be pointed at files first
  (`log(access: path, error: path)`); anything else throws `.invalidInput`
  naming the fix. At most the trailing 256 KiB are read.
- `Xray.XraySessionProviding` is the session's protocol surface for apps
  that inject a mock in their own tests; `newSession()` returns the real
  thing.

`Xray.shared.launch(_:)` / `Xray.shared.stop()` are the underlying primitives the session
delegates to; prefer the session unless you are sure you want the bare calls.

### `Xray.Routing`: where traffic goes

`routing` is the routing section itself. Rule order and strategy are exactly
what you declare. Any routing section already in the document is replaced;
use `transform` to merge with existing rules.

```swift
Xray.shared.routing(
    domainStrategy: .ipIfNonMatch,  // or .asIs / .ipOnDemand; nil omits it (Routing.DomainStrategy)
    rules: [
        Xray.shared.routingRule(domains: ["geosite:ads", "full:tracker.example.com"],
                                destination: .proxy),
        Xray.shared.routingRule(ips: ["geoip:private", "192.168.0.0/16"],
                                destination: .direct),
        Xray.shared.routingRule(inboundTags: ["dns-in"], destination: .dns),
    ],
    final: .proxy  // catches whatever no rule matched; nil omits it
)
```

`Rule` fields (all default to empty/nil; only what you set is written):
`domains` (plain `example.com`, `full:`, `domain:`, `regexp:`, `geosite:`),
`ips` (CIDR, `geoip:`), `port` (`"443"`, `"80,443"`), `network` (`"tcp"`,
`"udp"`), `protocols` (sniffed: `http`, `tls`, `bittorrent`),
`inboundTags`, and `destination`. Fields within a rule combine with AND,
rules combine with OR. Every rule should carry a destination; rules without
one write no `outboundTag` and match nothing useful.

`geosite:` / `geoip:` categories need the corresponding `.dat` files where
the engine will look for its assets — and the assembly enforces that before
anything launches (see [Geo databases](#geo-databases)). Turning a plain
domain or IP list into a database lookup is the only thing that requires
them; everything else routes without any database.

### `Xray.DNS`, `Xray.FakeDNS`, `Xray.Log`: verbatim sections

`dns`, `fakeDNS`, and `log` are verbatim like `routing`: what you declare is
what lands, replacing anything already in the document. Empty collections and
nil fields are omitted from the wire rather than written empty.

```swift
Xray.shared.dns(
    hosts: ["geosite:malware": "127.0.0.1"],  // default empty
    queryStrategy: .useIPv4,                  // or .useIP / .useIPv6; nil omits it (DNS.QueryStrategy)
    servers: [                                // default empty
        .detailed(address: "fakedns", domains: ["geosite:category-ir"]),
        .plain("https://dns.google/dns-query"),
    ]
)
Xray.shared.fakeDNS(ipPool: "198.18.0.0/16", poolSize: 512)  // one array entry; both required
Xray.shared.log(
    level: .warning,     // or .debug / .info / .error / .none; nil omits it
    access: "/path/access.log",  // nil omits it
    error: "/path/error.log",    // nil omits it
    dnsLog: true                 // nil omits it
)
```

Servers take both engine forms — a bare address (`.plain`) or an address
scoped to domains (`.detailed`). A complete document therefore assembles like
this: `outbounds` arrive from conversion or your skeleton; `log`, `dns`,
`fakedns`, and `routing` are typed options; entries and standards are derived;
and anything schema-exotic rides in the typed tree via `transform`/`patch`.

### Proxy mode vs TUN mode

Proxy mode moves one app's traffic: the engine opens ports on your own device
and traffic you deliberately send there goes through. On macOS a system proxy
setting covers the whole machine; on iOS it covers your app's own requests —
other apps are untouched, with zero system involvement and no entitlements.

TUN mode is device-wide capture through the engine's own `tun` inbound —
the documented shape the published Xray clients run, verified against the
stock engine (a `protocol: tun` document passes `validate()` and launches
with a handed-off descriptor; a live test in the suite proves both). The
engine reads packets off a TUN interface, and who owns that interface
decides the setup:

- **macOS**: the engine creates the interface itself from the entry's `name`
  (e.g. `"utun10"`) — no descriptor needed, just route traffic at it via
  `autoSystemRoutingTable` (e.g. `["0.0.0.0/0", "::/0"]`) so packets arrive.
  Creating a utun unprivileged fails with "operation not permitted", so the
  engine-running process needs the usual VPN privileges for this path.
- **iOS**: the interface belongs to your NetworkExtension, so the provider
  reads its file descriptor and hands it over through
  `TunEntry(fileDescriptor:)` — the kit merges it into the document's `env`
  as `xray.tun.fd`, the variable Xray-core reads from its own environment
  at launch. Nil descriptor, like nil entry, writes no `env` key: proxy-mode
  documents never carry tunnel state. The read itself is one call:
  `providerFileDescriptor(from: packetFlow)` takes the provider's flow (as a
  plain `NSObject`, no import needed) and returns the descriptor, throwing
  `.invalidInput` when the key path is absent or the value unusable.

`Xray.TunEntry` fields, all defaulted: `tag` (`"tunIn"`), `listen`
(`"127.0.0.1"`), `name` (nil — the engine's default), `mtu` (1500),
`gateway` (nil — e.g. `["198.18.0.1/15", "fc00::1/64"]`; IPv4 only on
macOS), `userLevel` (nil — level 0),
`autoSystemRoutingTable` (nil — e.g. `["0.0.0.0/0", "::/0"]`),
`autoOutboundsInterface` (nil — `"auto"` lets the engine choose, which it
already implies when the routing table is set but this is missing),
`fileDescriptor` (nil), and `sniffing` (default sniffing;
nil entries still receive the assembly's sniffing). The entry carries no
port and no auth — traffic arrives as packets, not connections — so keep
any SOCKS listener on localhost *and* guarded when both modes coexist.

One environment subtlety the kit handles: the engine applies the document's
`env` entries into its own process at launch and never unsets them, so a
descriptor from an earlier tunnel session would hijack the next fd-less
launch. Assembling with a descriptor-less `TunEntry` therefore clears
`xray.tun.fd` (both spellings) from the process environment automatically.

The provider half, all outside this package: set the tunnel network settings
with default routes and DNS pointing at the utun interface; read the
interface's file descriptor; assemble with the descriptor and launch from
inside the provider process — the engine must run where the interface lives
(the extension on iOS, the app on macOS):

```swift
let tun = try Xray.shared.tun(
    gateway: ["198.18.0.1/15"],
    autoSystemRoutingTable: ["0.0.0.0/0"],
    autoOutboundsInterface: "auto",
    fileDescriptor: fd   // from the provider's utun interface; omit on macOS
)
try Xray.shared.newSession().start(
    .shareLinks(serverFeed),
    options: Xray.shared.options(tun: tun)
)
```

`validate` checks the tun document like any other, and `build` lets you
inspect the exact document the provider will run before you ship it there.
Installing the tunnel needs a VPN configuration the user approves once
(Settings → General → VPN); proxy mode needs none of that, at the cost of
dying with your app process.

Xray.shared.writeGeoInventory(database: String, kind: GeoDatabase, in: URL) throws -> URL
Xray.shared.proxyConfiguration(_ source: Config.Source, remarks: String? = nil, socksPort: Int? = 10808, httpPort: Int? = nil, routing: Xray.Routing? = nil, dns: Xray.DNS? = nil, log: Xray.Log? = nil) throws -> Config
```

- `version()` answers, for example, "26.10.29", the Xray-core build compiled
  into the framework. `health()` is the watchdog probe: false when nothing is
  running, true when an instance is up *and* answering, and a throw when the
  bridge itself is wedged. Poll it on a timer; a throw means rebuild, not
  retry.
- `findAvailablePorts` asks the engine for TCP ports nothing else on this
  machine is currently listening on. Nothing is killed or reserved — it is a
  check, and a port can be taken between the answer and your launch. Useful
  for client configurations whose inbounds listen locally, since picking
  hardcoded port ranges means collisions more often than not. `excluding`
  skips port numbers you already have.
- `verifyAvailablePorts` goes one step further: every returned port also
  passes a real TCP bind against 127.0.0.1 first. The engine's answer is a
  snapshot, and something else can grab a port between the answer and your
  launch — this closes that hole. Throws `.bridgeFailed` when not enough
  bindable ports turn up, `.invalidInput` for a count below 1. Prefer it for
  any port the engine will actually listen on (entries, metrics); the check
  is best-effort at call time, not a reservation.
- `decodeSubscription` unwraps a provider's Age-encrypted subscription
  export: text starting with the Age armor header is decrypted with
  `ageSecret`, and *any other text comes back unchanged*. It does not parse
  links and does not base64-decode — that is `Config(shareLinks:)`'s job,
  which takes a single link, many newline-separated links, a base64 blob,
  a `{"outbounds":[...]}` JSON blob, or this function's output. Pass the
  `AGE-SECRET-KEY-...` string as `ageSecret` for encrypted exports.
- `generateAgeKeyPair` makes keys for encrypted feeds: `AgeKeyPair.Kind.x25519`
  gives the classic pair, `.hybrid` folds ML-KEM-768 over it for post-quantum
  resistance. The secret stays on the device (`AGE-SECRET-KEY-...`, keep it
  out of logs); the public half (`age1...`) is publishable.
- `writeGeoInventory` reads a GeoIP/GeoSite `.dat` file and writes every
  code/region with rule and category counts next to it as `<database>.json`;
  `.geosite` maps to hostname databases, `.geoip` to IP ranges. The
  `database` name is the filename without extension (`"geosite"` for
  `geosite.dat`); `directory` is the folder holding the `.dat`. Returns the
  inventory file's URL.

### Value factories on `Xray.shared`

Every value above has a factory twin, so user code passes values to functions
and never spells a type name. Same defaults as the inits; factories with a
rule throw `.invalidInput` instead of failing inside the engine:

```swift
Xray.shared.routingRule(domains:ips:port:network:protocols:inboundTags:destination:) -> Routing.Rule
Xray.shared.routing(domainStrategy:rules:final:) -> Routing
Xray.shared.dns(hosts:queryStrategy:servers:) -> DNS
Xray.shared.fakeDNS(ipPool:poolSize:) -> FakeDNS
Xray.shared.log(level:access:error:dnsLog:) -> Log
Xray.shared.tun(tag:listen:name:mtu:gateway:userLevel:...:fileDescriptor:sniffing:) throws -> TunEntry
Xray.shared.providerFileDescriptor(from: NSObject) throws -> Int32  // pass the provider's packetFlow
Xray.shared.socksEntry(tag:listen:port:udp:auth:sniffing:) throws -> Assembly.SocksEntry
Xray.shared.httpEntry(tag:listen:port:auth:sniffing:) throws -> Assembly.HttpEntry
Xray.shared.dnsRelay(tag:listen:port:address:remotePort:network:) throws -> Assembly.DNSRelay
Xray.shared.credentials(username:password:) -> Credentials
Xray.shared.sniffing(destOverride:enabled:routeOnly:domainsExcluded:metadataOnly:) -> Sniffing
Xray.shared.options(sniffing:transform:routing:credentials:tun:environment:observatory:geoCheck:dns:fakeDNS:log:metricsPort:) -> Session.Options
Xray.shared.metrics(tag:port:) throws -> Metrics
Xray.shared.observatory(subjectSelector:probeURL:probeInterval:enableConcurrency:) -> Observatory
Xray.shared.trafficMonitor(port:host:timeoutSeconds:) throws -> TrafficMonitor
Xray.shared.trafficWatchdog(port:host:interval:stalledAfter:onStall:) throws -> TrafficWatchdog
Xray.shared.pingTarget(config:outboundTag:) -> PingTarget
Xray.shared.pingOptions(timeoutSeconds:testURL:) throws -> PingOptions
Xray.shared.geoDownloader(geoIPURL:geoSiteURL:) -> GeoDownloader
Xray.shared.ensureAssets(for:databases:in:geoIPURL:geoSiteURL:) async throws -> URL
```

`throws` marks the ones with a rule: ports must be 1–65535, the TUN
descriptor non-negative, the ping timeout positive. `providerFileDescriptor`
takes the provider's packet flow as a plain `NSObject` (no NetworkExtension
import needed) and walks its `socket.fileDescriptor` key path with a
capability check at each hop, so an iOS release that renames the key throws
`.invalidInput` instead of tripping an Objective-C exception — re-verify it
per iOS release. `ensureAssets` only downloads databases that are missing or
unreadable, never refetches what is there. Enum cases
(`.block`, `.plain(...)`, `.proxy`, …) and engine-made values
(`AgeKeyPair`, snapshots, deltas) need no factories — cases already are
value-passing calls, and read-models come from the engine.

`Security` framework and libresolv are linked by the package, so the Go
runtime inside libXray resolves its TLS and DNS symbols without you adding
anything to the target.

### `Xray.shared.ping`: latency through the real path

```swift
let targets = [Xray.shared.pingTarget(config: serverJson)]  // outboundTag nil = engine picks
let options = try Xray.shared.pingOptions(timeoutSeconds: 10, testURL: "https://yourapp.com/ping")
let results = try Xray.shared.ping(targets, options: options)
// PingResult: succeeded, latencyMilliseconds, failureReason?
```

Each measurement completes a full HTTP request through the outbound, so
success covers routing and TLS handshakes, not just a bare TCP probe.
Targets pair a server's compact Xray JSON (only its `outbounds` are read)
with an optional outbound tag — nil lets the engine pick the outbound tagged
`"proxy"`, else the first one. Answers come back in input order, each
carrying `succeeded`, `latencyMilliseconds` (real measurement, in ms), and —
on failure — `failureReason`.

Four rules throw `.invalidInput` before touching the engine: no targets, more
than five targets per call (split larger pools into batches), a timeout of
zero or less (seconds, whole-batch deadline), and a test URL that is not an
absolute HTTP(S) URL. A fifth: the engine must be stopped, because it
measures in an isolated instance of its own — measuring while running throws
before the call instead of the engine's refusal. Blocking, so prefer a
background task or wrap it in `Task.detached` yourself.

The test URL is what the engine actually fetches through each outbound, so
point it at an endpoint that answers fast and empty — a `204 No Content` is
ideal, and your own endpoint measures your real path rather than the
internet's. If your endpoint goes down, every target reports failure with
your outage as the reason, so check the endpoint directly before blaming the
servers.

### `Xray.TrafficMonitor`: live speed and totals

```swift
var assembly = Xray.shared.assembler(.shareLinks(text))
assembly.metricsPort = verifiedPort   // adds the Metrics listener + stats + policy switches
let config = try assembly.assemble()
try session.start(config)

let monitor = try Xray.shared.trafficMonitor(port: verifiedPort)
var previous = try await monitor.snapshot()
while running {
    try await Task.sleep(for: .seconds(1))
    let now = try await monitor.snapshot()
    let speed = now.delta(since: previous)
    print(speed.upPerSecond, speed.downPerSecond)  // bytes/sec both ways
    totals.up += speed.totalUp                      // accumulate for the session
    totals.down += speed.totalDown
    previous = now
}
```

The engine already publishes per-tag byte counters on a localhost HTTP
endpoint (`/debug/vars`) — no new dependencies, no OS-version gating, stock
binary. Setting `metricsPort` writes the three config pieces that enable it:
the `metrics` listener on `127.0.0.1:port`, an empty `stats` section, and the
four `policy.system` stats switches (merged into your existing policy, never
replacing it). Out-of-range ports throw `.invalidInput` at assembly, before
anything launches.

`snapshot()` returns a `TrafficSnapshot`: per-tag `inbound`/`outbound`
dictionaries of `TrafficCounter` (`up`, `down`, `total`), plus summed
`totalUp`/`totalDown`. `delta(since:)` diffs two snapshots into a
`TrafficDelta` — per-tag bytes moved in the interval, totals, and
`upPerSecond`/`downPerSecond` derived from the wall-clock gap, so polling
once a second reads as live speed. If the engine restarted between
snapshots, the whole later reading counts as new traffic rather than going
negative. Unreachable endpoints and non-200 answers throw `.bridgeFailed`;
poll failures in your loop should keep the last good values and retry, the
same way you'd treat any sampled signal.

#### `Xray.Observatory`: which outbounds are actually alive

HTTP counters say how much moved; an observatory says whether each outbound
*could* move anything right now. The engine probes every selected outbound
through itself on an interval and publishes the answers on the same Metrics
endpoint:

```swift
var assembly = Xray.shared.assembler(.shareLinks(text))
assembly.metricsPort = verifiedPort
assembly.observatory = Xray.shared.observatory(
    subjectSelector: ["fast"],        // probe outbound tags with this prefix
    probeInterval: "1m"               // Go duration: "30s", "2m", "1h"
)
let config = try assembly.assemble()

// later, from the same snapshot() call:
let health = snapshot.observatory["fast-v1"]
if health?.alive == true, let ms = health?.delayMilliseconds {
    print("fast-v1: \(ms) ms")
} else {
    print("fast-v1 down:", health?.failureReason ?? "no probe yet")
}
```

`OutboundProbe` fields: `alive`, `delayMilliseconds` (nil when no successful
probe is on record), `failureReason` (the engine's own text for the last
failure), `lastSeen`, `lastTry`. Probing costs a real network request per
selected outbound per interval — pick `subjectSelector` deliberately and
keep the interval honest. Without an `observatory` section the field reads
empty; without `metricsPort` there is no place to read the answers.

### Geo databases

Two jobs live here: fail fast when a required database is absent, and fetch
the ones that are.

**The gate.** The engine resolves `geosite:` / `geoip:` entries lazily at
traffic time, so a missing file turns into silent dead routing — `validate()`
passes, real requests just fail. Every `session.build` / `validate` / `start`
therefore checks that the databases the routing *and* dns sections reference
exist and parse where the engine will look: the document's
`env["xray.location.asset"]` first (set it via `Options.environment`), then
the process environment, then the executable's directory. A missing, empty,
or garbage file throws `.geoAssets`, naming the database and every directory
searched. Plain domains and CIDRs never trigger the check, and
`Options.geoCheck: false` turns it off entirely for documents you verify
yourself.

**The fetch.** The engine only inventories databases it already has.
Fetching them is a separate step, and this package covers it too:

```swift
let downloader = Xray.shared.geoDownloader()
try await downloader.download(into: dataDir) { progress in
    print("Geo files: \(Int(progress * 100))%")
}
```

Both files download concurrently into `directory` as `geoip.dat` and
`geosite.dat`, replacing same-named files. Defaults point at the lightweight
rule sets; pass `geoIPURL` / `geoSiteURL` (at init or per call) to use your
own mirror. The callback reports combined 0.0 to 1.0 progress on the main
actor and is optional. Configure URLs before the first download, then treat
the instance as read-only. `Xray.GeoDownloader.defaultGeoIPURL` and
`.defaultGeoSiteURL` expose the bundled defaults;
`Xray.GeoDatabase.geosite` / `.geoip` name which database a call is about.
Underneath, `Xray.GeoAssets` is the gate itself: it finds the candidate
directories (document `env`, process environment, executable folder),
verifies each referenced `.dat` by its protobuf framing, and throws
`.geoAssets` naming the missing, corrupt, or unreadable file.

**The upkeep.** First launches download; every launch after only fills gaps.
`ensureAssets` scans the assembled config (or an explicit list) for
`geosite:` / `geoip:` references and downloads only the databases that are
missing or unreadable — files already present are never refetched, and a
document with plain-domain rules downloads nothing at all:

```swift
let directory = try await Xray.shared.ensureAssets(for: config, in: dataDir)
let options = Xray.shared.options(environment: ["xray.location.asset": directory.path])
try session.start(.json(config.json), options: options)
```

Omit `for:` to fetch the pair regardless of references, or pass
`databases:` to pin the list. The returned directory feeds straight into
`Options.environment`, closing the loop with the gate above.

### `Xray.Error`: four cases

```swift
Xray.Error.engineFailed(String)  // the engine refused; the string carries why
Xray.Error.bridgeFailed(String)  // our side couldn't talk to it or decode its answer
Xray.Error.invalidInput(String)  // rejected before the call: bad ports, >5 ping
                                 // targets, empty outbounds with .proxy routing,
                                 // oversized (>16 MiB) raw requests, ...
Xray.Error.geoAssets(String)     // a geosite:/geoip: reference has no readable
                                 // database — see Geo databases for the fix
```

`.engineFailed` strings come from the engine ("no valid outbound found" and
friends) and can change wording between engine releases — match on them only
as a last resort. `.invalidInput` and `.geoAssets` are the package's own
voice: deterministic, documented above, and safe to switch on. Every case also
carries `recoveryHint`, a one-line pointer at where to look next.

### The typed tree: `Xray.JSONValue`

Everything `transform` and `patch` touch is this enum — null, bool, int,
double, string, array, object — `Codable`, `Sendable`, `Hashable`, with
literal and dynamic-member support, so documents build and read without a
single cast:

```swift
var doc: Xray.JSONValue = ["log": ["loglevel": "warning"]]  // dictionary literal
doc["log"]?["loglevel"] = "error"        // write through subscripts
doc.log?.loglevel?.stringValue           // "error", via dynamic members
doc["missing"]                           // nil — reading is nil-safe, never traps
doc.inbounds?[0]?["tag"]?.stringValue    // index, then field, then typed read
```

Subscripts return optionals (nil for missing or mistyped paths); typed
accessors (`isNull`, `boolValue`, `intValue`, `doubleValue`, `stringValue`,
`arrayValue`, `objectValue`) do the same. Assigning nil through a subscript
removes the key. `Xray.JSONObject` is `[String: Xray.JSONValue]`, the shape
every configuration document takes. Integers decode as ints (never silently
promoted to doubles), so ports and pool sizes survive the round trip exactly.

### Raw bridge

The engine's protocol is a single JSON call:
`{"apiVersion":3,"method":"...","payload":{...}}` in,
`{"success":Bool,"data":...,"error":"..."}` out. If this wrapper lags a new
upstream capability, bypass it:

```swift
let request = #"{"apiVersion":3,"method":"xrayVersion"}"#
let response = try Xray.shared.sendRawRequest(request)
print(response)
```

`sendRawRequest` throws `Xray.Error` on engine-reported failure and frees the
engine's malloc'd answer internally. Requests over 16 MiB are rejected as
`.invalidInput` before crossing the bridge — the engine's own ceiling, so a
well-formed giant request still fails exactly as it would remotely, without
paying for the round trip. Anything you pass with an `apiVersion`
the engine does not know earns "unsupported apiVersion", which is also your
signal that the embedded engine advanced and this wrapper's public methods
are the ones to prefer. The bare `CGoInvoke` / `CGoFree` C functions stay
reachable for emergencies; if you call `CGoInvoke` yourself, capture the
pointer and release it with `CGoFree`.

## Updating the engine across releases

The nightly job handles it. Timeline goes: at midnight UTC the workflow reads
XTLS/libXray's latest release; if no matching tag exists here, it downloads
upstream's `libxray-apple-cgo.zip`, hashes it, rewrites the `url` and
`checksum` lines in `Package.swift` to that release, commits, tags
`v<version>` (upstream "libXray v26.10.29" is release and tag `v26.10.29`
here, plain), and publishes the release. A follow-up `swift test` job on a
macOS runner runs the suite against the new tag as a consumer would.

After that, your app does not move on its own. With an exact requirement,
moving to the new engine is one deliberate change of the version string in
your manifest (Xcode: edit the package's Exact Version field), followed by a
resolve that fetches that day's archive straight from XTLS/libXray. Resolving
at, say, `26.10.31` embeds exactly the engine that tag's `Package.swift`
names. Nothing binary is committed here; this repository only ever changes by
two manifest lines per release.

You can also trigger the job from the Actions tab with workflow_dispatch if
you want the newest engine before the next midnight.

## Troubleshooting

- **"unsupported apiVersion"** — XTLS/libXray bumped its bridge protocol. The
  constant to update is `protocolVersion` inside
  `Sources/XrayKit/Calls/EngineTransport.swift`,
  taken from the `LibXrayAPIVersion` in upstream `invoke_model.go` (and please
  open an issue so the next daily version also carries the fix).
- **"no valid outbound found"** — the engine declined every entry you passed.
  Share links need to be fully specified; a bare `vless://uuid@host:443`
  without scheme defaults will not build. Validate with `validate()` for
  detail on a JSON config.
- **linker failures mentioning `Sec*` or `res_9_*` symbols** — your app built
  against the binary target directly instead of going through `XrayKit`.
  Depend on the `XrayKit` product, which owns the framework and library
  linkage.
- **Package resolution hangs or fails on "unsupported platform"** — the
  framework has no watchOS/visionOS slices, so those destinations cannot use
  this package, now or later.

## Staying connected: the rebuild recipe

The engine is process-global and silent when it dies: network changes,
sleep/wake, or a crash leave the tunnel up with nothing moving. The package
gives you the three primitives; the app owns the loop:

1. **Liveness** — poll `session` counters, not just `health()`. `health()`
   proves the bridge answers; advancing `totalUp/totalDown` proves traffic
   moves. `TrafficWatchdog` does the polling and calls `onStall` after
   `stalledAfter` with no movement (latched — one fire per episode, reset by
   any traffic). An idle tunnel reads as stalled, so start it after first
   traffic or set the window generously:

   ```swift
   let watchdog = try engine.trafficWatchdog(port: metricsPort, stalledAfter: .seconds(60)) {
       Task { await rebuild() }   // hop off the watchdog's task
   }
   watchdog.start()
   ```

2. **Path changes** — watch `NWPathMonitor` in the app (it stays app policy,
   the package never owns it). On an unsatisfied path, debounce ~2s (tunnels
   flap during handover), then rebuild.
3. **Rebuild** — `stop()` is safe when idle, so rebuild unconditionally:
   `try? session.stop()`, then `start(remoteSubscription:deadline:)` (or the
   assemble path) with backoff 1s → 2s → 4s capped, then surface the failure
   to the user instead of retrying forever. Prefer the async deadline start
   everywhere in providers: a thrown error is recoverable, a watchdog kill
   of an overstaying sync start is not.
4. **Forensics** — when a rebuild fires, attach `session.recentLogs()` and
   `session.recentEngineLogs()` to the report. The first says what the
   package did; the second says what the engine saw.

## Complete example: from subscription to running engine

One call that uses the whole surface: bind-checked ports, guarded entries,
selective proxying for a single host, verbatim DNS and logging, metrics with
live speed, validation before launch, a pinned session for answers, and
cleanup. Proxy mode, app process, background task — `start` blocks until the
engine is up, so it never runs on the main thread.

```swift
import XrayKit

final class ProxyService: NSObject {
    static let shared = ProxyService()

    // Held for the app's lifetime: the engine runs until stop, and this is
    // the handle on that lifecycle.
    private let session = Xray.shared.newSession(logger: { print("[xray]", $0) })
    private var proxied: URLSession = .shared

    private let proxyUser = "proxy-user"
    private let proxyPass = "s3cret"
    private let answersHost = "answers.example.com"
    private var httpPort = 10809
    private var totals: (up: Int64, down: Int64) = (0, 0)

    /// Assemble, validate, launch, and pin a URLSession to the HTTP entry.
    /// Throws Xray.Error — let the caller fall back to a direct fetch.
    func start(subscription: String) throws {
        // Bind-checked up front: entries and metrics all get ports nothing
        // else is listening on, so launch can't fail on a collision.
        let ports = try Xray.shared.verifyAvailablePorts(count: 3)
        httpPort = ports[1]
        let credentials = Xray.shared.credentials(username: proxyUser, password: proxyPass)
        var assembly = Xray.shared.assembler(.shareLinks(subscription))
        assembly.remarks = "main"
        assembly.socks = try Xray.shared.socksEntry(port: ports[0], auth: credentials)
        assembly.http = try Xray.shared.httpEntry(port: ports[1], auth: credentials)
        assembly.routing = Xray.shared.routing(
            domainStrategy: .ipIfNonMatch,
            rules: [
                // Local DNS relay traffic goes to the dns outbound.
                Xray.shared.routingRule(inboundTags: ["dns-in"], destination: .dns),
                // Only this host rides the proxy. Everything else falls
